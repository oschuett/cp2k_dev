Compiling with CUDA support
---------------------------

These tools are intended to allow CP2K to perform portions of the calculation on NVIDIA graphics cards using the CUDA API.  In order to use these features you need a CUDA compatible graphics card.  In addition, you must download and install the CUDA toolkit, CUDA SDK, and a CUDA compatible NVIDIA driver.  These can be obtained from NVIDIA's website.

To compile CP2K with CUDA support, three modifications must be made to the arch file.  An example is provided in arch/Linux-x86-64-cuda.sopt.  The necessary modifications are:

1)  Add a line "NVCC = nvcc" pointing the makefile to the nvcc compiler.

2)  Add -D__CUDA and -D__FFTSGL to the DFLAGS variable.

3)  Add libcudart.so and libcufft.so to the LIBS variable.

Then, compile as normal.

Features
--------
At the moment, the only portion of the calculation which can be performed on the graphics card is the FFT.  Because NVIDIA graphics card only support single precision floating point arithmetic, the FFT must be performed in single precision (hence the -D__FFTSGL option.)

There are plans to support o
