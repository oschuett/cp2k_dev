libsmm: a library for small matrix multiplies.

in order to deal efficiently with small matrix multiplies,
often involving 'special' matrix dimensions such as 5,13,17,22, 
a dedicated matrix library can be generated that outperforms (or matches) general purpose (optimized) blas libraries.

Generation requires extensive compilation and timing runs, and is machine specific, 
i.e. the library should be constructed on the architecture it is supposed to run.
Using an 8 core machine, generation takes approx. 4 hours.

How to generate the library (on a computer that allows for both execution and compilation)

1) Modify config.in to set options such as compiler, compilation flags, blas library,
   matrix sizes, and the number of available cores.

2) Run the master script ./do_all

3) the library is generated, check test_smm_*.out for performance, and correctness.

4) Intermediate files (but not some key output and the library itself) might be removed using ./do_clean
