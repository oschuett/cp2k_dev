The arch files provided here should be used as examples, your local setup (in particular paths to libraries will invariably differ). Furthermore, some of the arches might be as much outdated as the corresponding hardware/OS. There are particular caveats for the following machines/compilers.

g95:
typically doing fine. If the current snapshot fails, try the stable version (which cannot be used for our LIBINT interface, though).

PGI compilers:
tend to miscompile CP2K. Be sure to run a full regtest without segfaults before believing your compiler works.

Intel compilers:
Recent compilers (9.1) seem to be doing well. Be sure the allow for enough stack size as otherwise you might see segfaults (see Intel's release notes). In a bash shell, use 'ulimit -s 256000'
