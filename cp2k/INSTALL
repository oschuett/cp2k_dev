How to compile CP2K code
========================

 1) Acquire the code:

    The preferred method is to download it from the CVS, 
    using http://cp2k.berlios.de/
    put the code in ~/cp2k/ or equivalent

 2a) gnu make should be on your system (gmake or make on linux), 
     go to http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html to get it
 2b) a f90 compiler, blass and lapack should be installed
 2c) mpi and scalapack might be needed for parallel runs
 2d) fftw could be an advantage but is not needed

 3) to compile the code use : 

    > cd cp2k/makefiles; make sopt; make popt 

    "p" stands for parallel (alternatively "s" = serial)
    "opt" means to buil an optimised version (alternatively "dbg" = debugging)

 3b) These easily fails, but there are a number of easy fixes (step 4,5)

 4) In the likely order of occurence :

    - ~/cp2k/arch/*.* files have some paths to libraries hard-wired 
       (e.g. blass, lapack, ...). 
       be sure to remove e.g. __FFTW if you don not have it. __FFTSG 
       is always there. 

    - ~/cp2k/tools/get_arch_code returns unknown for the architecture
      try to have it return the closest possible match.
      have a look in ~/cp2k/arch for the possible options (or see step 7)
 
 5) If your machine is really not there, it shouldn't be too difficult to add.
    Only ~/cp2k/src/machine*.F should be affected.

 6) If compilation works fine, you can go into one of the test cases 
    and try out the executable

>  cd ~/cp2k/tests/QS/
> ~/cp2k/exe/YOURMACHINE/cp2k.sopt H2O.inp

 6b) you could have a look in ~/cp2k/doc if your run fails

 7) In any case please tell us your comments, praise, criticism, thanks, ...

 8) Happy computing!
